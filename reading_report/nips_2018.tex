% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two

% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to

% if LaTeX puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last
% on the second line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third

\section*{Cloud Computing and Grid Computing 360-Degree Compared}

In this paper an in-depth comparison is made between Grid Computing and Cloud
Computing. Grids are defined by Ian Foster as 1) coordinated resources that are
not subject to centralized control, 2) uses standard, open, general-purpose
protocols and interfaces, and 3) delivers non-trivial qualities of service. The
first two do not clearly hold for Clouds, while the third does. There is little
consensus on how to define Clouds, however the author defines them as: ``A
large-scale distributed computing paradigm that is driven by economies of scale,
in which a pool of abstracted virtualized dynamically-scalable, managed
computing power, storage, platforms, and services are delivered on demand to
external customers over the Internet.''
To further support these definitions, the author compares Grids and Clouds from
different perspectives: architecture, security model, business model,
programming model, virtualization, data model, compute model, provenance and
applications.

Clouds charge the users using creditcards based on per
instance-hours, GB-Month of storage, TB / month data transfer, or similar
metrics. For Grids, mostly found in academia or government labs,  the users
provide proposals for projects, which are assigned service units (like CPU
hours) which they can spend. Architecturally, Clouds can be implemented over
existing Grid technologies. The Grid starting point was to use federated
resources comprising of compute, storage and network resources. These generally
heterogeneous and dynamic resources can come from multiple geographically
distributed institutions: ``Virtual Organizations''. To support these, Grid
protocol architecture define standard protocols, middleware, toolkits, and
services with interoperability and security as their primary concerns. Grids
provide protocols and services at five different layers. 1) The fabric layer are
the resources types such as compute, storage, etc. 2) Connectivity layer defines
communication and authentication. 3) Resource layer defined protocols for
publication, monitoring, accounting and payment. 4) Collective layer capture
interactions acress collections of resources. 5) Application layer comprises the
user application built on all the protocols. For Clouds the protocol
architecture consists of four layers. 1) Fabric layer similar to Grids. 2)
Unified resource layer containing resource that have been abstracted
/encapsulated (usually using virtualization). 3) The platform layer consisting
of a set of specialized tools, middleware, and services to provide development
and/or deployment. 4) Application layer similar to Grids. Clouds generally
provide services at three levels. 1) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
provisioning hardware, software and equipments. 2) Platform as a Service (PaaS)
provisioning high-level integrated environments. 3). Software as a Service
(SaaS) delivers special purpose software remotely accessible for the user.

Resources in Grids are often batch-scheduled, where a resource manager process
requests of users for a number of resources. Based on the user credentials
requests are processed and accounting is done. Clouds resource model is very
different, as all resource in the Cloud are shared by all users at the same
time. This makes providing a good level of QoS a non-trivial task and will
likely be one of the major challenges in Cloud Computing. Data-wise Clouds and
Grids face similar issues when the scale of the data grows every year. Moving
data repeatedly to distant CPUs is becoming a bottleneck. To archive good
scalability Clouds, Grids, and their applications must distribute data over many
computers and computations must be steered towards the best place to execute in
order to minimize communication costs. Critical is the combination of compute
and resources, as data movement will not scale to the peta-scale datasets and
could lead to underutilization of raw resources in both Clouds and Grids. While
Grids often deal with more data and progress has been made in data-aware
schedulers, however Clouds will face the same issues as the scales of the Clouds
grow. Virtualization in Clouds is used to provide necessary abstraction between
fabric and resource overlays. It enables encapsulation, providing better
security, manageability, and isolation in Clouds. Grids do not rely on
virtualization as much as Clouds do, as individual organization maintain full
control of the resources, however there are efforts to use virtualization as
well.

Monitoring in Clouds is a potential difficulty due to the virtualization. As
mentioned, Grid resources are not highly abstract as in clouds, making
monitoring easier. However, it can be argued that monitoring in Clouds is less
important as users are interacting with a more abstract layer that is
potentially more sophisticated. Provence refers to the derivation history of a
data product. It is different from monitoring in the sense that it provides a
overview of the past and supports the discovery and reproducibility of
scientific results. Provence in Clouds seems to be more challenging, as data
needs to be tracked across multiple service providers.

The software written in Grids does not differ fundamentally from traditional
parallel and distributed environments. Grids often target large scale scientific
computations and must scale to leverage large number of resources while
considering reliability and fault tolerance. Clouds seem to consist more of
mesh-up\'s and scripting, since there is no easy way to integrate services and
application from various providers.

In conclusion, the author has created an overview of the Cloud- and Grid
Computing paradigms. While the paper has been written 10 years ago, it gives a
very good overview of the differences in Clouds and Grids still present today.
Especially the concluding words of the author regarding the required protocols
and tools is still relevant today, as currently the tooling for Clouds and Grids
are advancing quickly.
